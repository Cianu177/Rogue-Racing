Thank you for purchasing the Customisable Sci Fi Vehicle from the Unity Asset Store!

=Changing the vehicles Base Colours:=
Within the package you will find a .png texture called "Sci_Fi_Vehicle_Base_Color_Layout".
Import it into your favourite image editing software and modify the texture in any way you want.
Save and import the new texture into Unity and then add it to the substance under the "Custom_Texture_Mask" Input.

=Edges and scratches:=
The Substance texture has various sliders that allow you to change the amount of paint scratches on the ship.
These are grouped under the "Edges" dropdown.

=Model:=
(Data from Blender)
Tris: 5.7k
Verts: 3k

=Other:=
-Try playing around with different shaders, e.g. the built-in toon shader is effective
