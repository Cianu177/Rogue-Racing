Easy to use antigravity ship.

Just drag&drop demoShip prefab and camera prefab to the scene.
Controlled by left/rigt keys depending on yout axis settings, so it works with controllers also.

For start "RaceShip Tilt" and "AIship" prefabs add GameManager to the scene (from Scripst folder), this will call OnShipStart event to start the race.

For mobile version add Joypad dual prefab and EventSystem.

For AI Controlled Ship use Utility / WayPoints Circuit, as shown in AI demo and Race demo scenes (prefab in Circuit folder)

To use your own ship modell, change the ship mesh in demoship prefab for your own.

To setup Race Position check and Wrong Way detection:
-need to have WayPoints Circuit on your scene with correct waypoints setup on your racetrack, see Race Demo scenes WayPoints Circuit for reference.
- on racers set the WayPoints Circuit object property on Distance Tracker component.
- on HUD Canvas set the Player / AI properties on HUD Manager component.
